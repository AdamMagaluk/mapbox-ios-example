# MapBox iOS Example

This is an example showing usage of the [MapBox iOS SDK](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-sdk) for: 
 
 1. Offline tile sources ([MBTiles](http://mbtiles.org)) with `RMMBTilesSource`

### Build instructions

 1. `git clone --recursive` to pull down dependencies
 1. Build & go!

Be sure to select the proper target -- the application itself -- so that both the app and its dependent libraries will build and the app will run from Xcode.
